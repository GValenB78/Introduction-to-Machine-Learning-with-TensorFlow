    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\\\$ 50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\\\$ 50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$ 50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$ 50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- The random forest algorithm has applications within [computational biology](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~qyj/papersA08/11-rfbook.pdf), allowing doctors to tackle problems such as gene expression classification, biomarker discovery, and sequence annotation. \n",
    "- *Reduced risk of overfitting*: Decision trees run the risk of overfitting as they tend to tightly fit all the samples within training data. However, when there’s a robust number of decision trees in a random forest, the classifier won’t overfit the model since the averaging of uncorrelated trees lowers the overall variance and prediction error. *Provides flexibility*: Feature bagging also makes the random forest classifier an effective tool for estimating missing values as it maintains accuracy when a portion of the data is missing.\n",
    "- *Time-consuming process*: Since random forest algorithms can handle large data sets, they can provide more accurate predictions, but can be slow to process data as they are computing data for each individual decision tree. *Requires more resources*: Since random forests process larger data sets, they’ll require more resources to store that data. *More complex*: The prediction of a single decision tree is easier to interpret when compared to a forest of them.\n",
    "- We are working with more than a hundred features, data has no missing values and we have enough resources and time to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/random-forest\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM can classify parts of an [image as a face and non-face and create a square boundary around the face](https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1322&context=etd_projects). \n",
    "- SVM works relatively well when there is a clear margin of separation between classes. SVM is more effective in high dimensional spaces. SVM is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. SVM is relatively memory efficient\n",
    "- *SVMs are not suitable for large datasets*: The complexity of the algorithm’s training is highly dependent on the size of the dataset. In other words, training time grows with the dataset to a point where it becomes infeasible to train and use due to compute constraints. However, training SVMs are much more scalable with dataset sizes nowadays. *SVMs perform poorly in imbalanced datasets*: The weakness of the soft margin optimization problem results in the hyperplanes being skewed to the minority class when imbalanced data is used for training and, due to an imbalanced support vector ratio, datapoints at the decision boundaries of the hyperplanes have a higher chance of being classified as negative. *SVMs with the ‘wrong’ kernel*: This is a somewhat intuitive one. For SVMs nowadays, choosing the right kernel function is key. As an example, using the linear kernel when the data are not linearly separable results in the algorithm performing poorly. However, choosing the ‘right’ kernel is another problem on its own, which among the techniques used, popular ones include varying the kernel function in the hyperparameter search. *When there is just too much noise in the data*: In these cases of noisy data, target classes are overlapping, in the sense that the features can have very similar or overlapping properties. This possibly results in arriving at several local optima due to the nature of the optimization algorithm, especially for high dimensional datasets. However, it is worthwhile to note that noise should not be the problem for kernels with high-bias, such as the linear and polynomial kernels. The issue of noise should lie more for the low-bias kernels such as the radial basis function (RBF).\n",

    "In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.\n",
    "  - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    "  - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.\n",
    "  - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.\n",

    "In summary, we have data well organized in a table, with 13 variables (such as age, race, sex, etc.) and a column named 'income' with labels of two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. People who make at most \\$ 50,000 annually, labeled \"<=50K\"\n",
    "2. People who make more than \\$ 50,000 annually, labeled \">50K\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is similar to Linear regression, except Logistic regression predicts wether something is true or false instead of predicting something continuous. Also, instead of fitting a line to the data, logistic regression fits an S-shaped curve called the Logistic or Sigmoid function. The curve goes from 0 to 1, and that means that the curve tells you the probability that an individual makes more than \\$ 50,000 annually or not based on the variables. We can test these variables to see if each of them is useful or not for the prediction: we can just test to see if a variable's effect on the prediction is significantly different from 0, if not it means the variable is not helping the prediction. Although this algorithm returns a probability, it's usually used for classification, in this case if the probability of an individual's income being labeled \">50K\" is more than 50\\% then we'll classify it as \">50K\", otherwise we'll classify it as \"<=50K\". To fit the line to the data, it uses something called \"Maximum Likelihood Estimation\". The maximum likelihood estimate is that set of regression coefficients for which the probability of getting the data we have observed is maximum. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained as follows: Draw the S-shaped curve, then pick a probability, scaled by the variables, of observing an individual who makes more than \\\\$ 50,000 and use that to calculate the likelihood of observing a an individual who makes at most \\$ 50,000 according to the variables, and then you calculate the likelihood of observing for all the individuals, and lastly you multiply all of those likelihoods together. That's the likelihood of the data given for this particular S-shaped curve. Then you shift the line and calculate a new likelihood of the data, and repeat: shift the line and calculate the likelihood again. Finally, the curve with the maximum likelihood is selected."

    "Both models are almost exactly the same, however, the optimized model got slightly worse results than the unoptimized one (0.02% less in accuracy and 0.07% less in F-score). While the optimized model has a 'C' value of 0.0001 and a penalty value of none, the unoptimized model has a 'C' value of 1 and a penalty of L2. I also tried a grid search of the max_iter parameter with 100, 200 and 300 iterations, but more than 100 didn't result on a better model. The naive predictor got an accuracy of 0.2478 and F-score of 0.2917 so both unoptimized and optimized models got way much better results."

    "I didn't consider hours-per-week to be in the top 5 most relevant features, I also didn't consider the marital-status, in particular the \"Married-civ-spouse\" category. It makes sense that people who work more hours make the most money, but I'm not sure why the marital status is such a good predictor, maybe this feature has some correlation with age. I considered the education-level feature in my top 5 but it doesn't appear in the graph, however, the education-num does. I guessed right that age was one of the most relevant features, but I didn't imagine it would be the number one feature. The capital gain feature was my closest guess as I think it would be the first and it turned out to be the third. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
